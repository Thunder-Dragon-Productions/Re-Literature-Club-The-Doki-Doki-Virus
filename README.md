The Doki Doki Virus</h1>
<p><i><b>Re:Literature Club! The Doki Doki Virus</i></b> (abbreviated as ReLC!TDDV, ReLC!, or TDDV) is a non-profit romance-to-horror story-based fan mod and <a href="https://sta.sh/2x0ii6hq2c3">scripted fan fiction series</a> created by TDPNeji/NejiHyuga900 for Team Salvato's 2017 visual novel <i><a href="http://ddlc.moe/">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></i> This mod serves as a non-canon fan sequel and continuation to the "special ending" of <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i> and thus, should be played after the player acquires the <b>special ending</b> by seeing all CGs in a single playthrough (via saving and reloading to the first poem before the end of Act I a few times).</p>

<h2>Download Instructions</h2>
<p>At the moment, there is no stable build good enough to play for a while. But, you can download the source code and apply the source code over a vanilla (clean) copy of <i><a href="http://ddlc.moe/">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></i> and play what was made so far. Drag the contents of the "game" folder from the downloaded ZIP of this mod to the "game" folder of the <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i> directory. At the moment, there is only about 30 seconds of gameplay as a test.</p>

<p>I, NejiHyuga900/TDPNeji, am still a newbie to game coding (I have made a few images and coded them in and made some title/main menu changes and some intro dialogues) and I plan on doing some crazy gameplay stuff later in the mod but just in case if it's incompatible with Ren'Py 6.99.12.4, I'm keeping things safe by writing my mod as a scripted fan fiction first. In case if this mod version fails, there will always be a scripted fan fiction to read instead.</p>

<h2>Modding Team</h2>
