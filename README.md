The Doki Doki Virus</h1>
<p><i><b>Re:Literature Club! The Doki Doki Virus</i></b> (abbreviated as ReLC!TDDV, ReLC!, or TDDV) is a non-profit romance-to-horror story-based fan mod and <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/tdpneji/gallery/65321344/re-literature-club-the-doki-doki-virus">scripted fanfiction series</a> created by TDPNeji/NejiHyuga900 for Team Salvato's 2017 visual novel <i><a href="http://ddlc.moe/">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></i> This mod serves as a non-canon fan sequel and continuation to the "special ending" of <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i> and thus, should be played after the player acquires the <b>special ending</b> by seeing all CGs in a single playthrough (via saving and reloading to the first poem before the end of Act I a few times).</p>

<h2>Download Instructions</h2>
<p>At the moment, there is no stable build good enough to play for a while. But, you can download the source code (latest release would always be from "Clone or Download") and apply the source code over a vanilla (clean) copy of <i><a href="http://ddlc.moe/">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></i> and play what was made so far. Drag the contents of the "game" folder from the downloaded ZIP of this mod to the "game" folder of the <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i> directory.</p>

<h2>Modding Team</h2>
<ul><li>TDPNeji/NejiHyuga900 - Mod/Fanfic Author, Writer, Musician, Character Concept Artist (I'm not good enough to match <a href="https://satchely.deviantart.com/">Satchely</a>'s artstyle), RPG Designer - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NejiHyuga900">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://tdpneji.deviantart.com/">DeviantART</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NejiHyuga900">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thunderdragontdp">Soundcloud</a>, <a href="https://thunderdragonproductions.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThunderDragonTDP">Facebook</a> (for music), <a href="https://twitter.com/NejiHyuga900">Twitter</a></li></ul>

<h3>Open roles</h3>
<ul><li>Background Artists - If you love making classrooms, bedrooms, hallways, and/or houses in Blender and can make them scary. NOTE: I'll need some/a lot of BG artists with at least some not being afraid of drawing bloody/dark backgrounds/scenes.</li>
<li>Character Artists - If anyone wants to improve my character drawings to be near or onpar with <a href="https://satchely.deviantart.com/">Satchely</a>'s artstyle once I do concept arts. NOTE: I will need A LOT of character artists with the huge amount of characters I have and some who aren't afraid of drawing heavily injured or deceased characters.</li>
<li>Experienced Coder(s) (I'm only a noob)
<ul><li>RPG Coder (I plan on turning this visual novel into a turn-based RPG much later and I wonder if anyone would like to assist me in RPG Maker MV. Maybe making plugins. Well, most YEP Plugins got me covered.)</li>
<li>RPG Level Designer(s) (May need help drawing tiles/assets for the RPG section.)</li>
<li>Rhythm Coder (Guitar Hero, DDR, or whatever rhythm style as I also plan on having a rhythm-based minigame too... I hope this is possible in RPG Maker MV)</li></li></ul>
<li>Sound Effects Composer (maybe)</li></ul>

<h4>Difficulty level</h4>
<ul><li><b>Writing</b> - Low-moderate. I already spent a whole year writing it as fanfic. It shouldn't take me as long to re-write it in the mod version (but knowing my pace as I do get distracted, I might drag it out like I had with my fanfic).</li>
<li><b>Visuals</b> - <b>Extremely high/God-tier</b> compared to other fan mods due to the numerous amount of character sprites, <a href="https://sta.sh/02eayquu1ss">expressions/poses</a>, backgrounds, etc. It's INSANE on how much stuff I added in my fanfic that would have to be drawn.</li>
<li><b>Music</b> - Low-moderate. I can make music. I usually make music in Guitar Pro (currently Guitar Pro 7 as its my preferred method of making music and tabs) but its RSE is not as good as VSTs, so I'll export to MIDI from Guitar Pro 5 (Guitar Pro 6 and 7 don't export to MIDI well so I'll export to GP5 first) and import them into REAPER and give the instruments high-quality VSTs that are free-to-use or public domain.</li>
<li><b>RPG level design</b> - Moderate, maybe? Well, it's just a school with 3 floors, staircases, classrooms, and some basements. Let's make it spooky like <i>Corpse Party</i>'s <a href="https://corpseparty.wikia.com/wiki/Heavenly_Host_Elementary_School">Heavenly Host Elementary</a>. At least level design here is pretty moderate considering the level design I have planned for a side prequel RPG is god-tier. This is going to be designed in RPG Maker MV. I experimented some basic level designing, trying to recreate the Literature Club classroom/clubroom (I figured out that they are the same room but at different angles) and corridor in RPG Maker MV v1.6.1.</li>

<li><b>RPG gameplay balance</b> - Low, maybe? Well, playtesters of various RPG skill level (noob to experts) could help this. The stats I gave each characters and enemies in the fanfic version may not be as balanced as I am hoping in this mod version. I do want the gameplay to be a bit challenging but playable for all players without having it to be too grindy. My set maximum level for playable characters' classes are 20. Using some inspirations from <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>, <i>Mega Man X: Command Mission</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i> (but not <i>FF1 NES</i>, <i>FF2</i> or <i>FF5</i> difficulty). Other than the ideas I have and used in my fanfic (that I know works in RPG Maker MV v1.6.1 with the use of plugins, mostly the <a href="http://yanfly.moe/">YEPs</a>), I haven't really tested out the battles for the enemies and bosses I made when I wrote my fanfic.</li>

<li><b>Overall difficulty</b> - INSANE! This is a <b>high-risk, highly ambitious</b> fan mod that could <b>easily fail</b> without any artistic volunteers (and this could take me many years alone with a mediocre output), which is why I made this was made as a fanfiction series first. Even then, the level of dedication would also have to VERY HIGH all around or this whole project will fall apart. I personally actually have doubts I could do something like this... Making Audio Mods like my <a href="https://redd.it/8v65gu">Zelda 1 Audio Mod</a> was easy (only took me 4 days for that), but this... this is like a 1000x higher level and if I were to do this alone, it may take me like 5–10 years or until I give up and move on. I actually really feel intimidated trying to do something this ambitious. Am I crazy? I would actually be surprised if I (or rather <i>we</i>) could do this.</li></ul>

<h4>Payments/Rewards for Volunteering</h4>
I am just one guy who doesn't make much money (even from making music), meaning I can't hire people to help me, but I can still offer some things for free (like songs I made that aren't selling) unless if you are willing to do this for free (which would be very generous...too generous for the tedious of work that needs to be done). Even if you don't get finished, you'll still receive credit and special thanks for the work you put in (if this ever gets finished).

It will be an extremely hard challenge for any artist to do all of the required drawing for the whole mod (whoever does this deserves to get the biggest praise in the world!!!). However, I doubt any artist in the world will be able to that for me for free. I don't think anyone would be up to that kind of challenge once they read through the amount of content I wrote in my fanfic version.
